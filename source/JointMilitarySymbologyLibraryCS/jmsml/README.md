# Building JMSML CSV Files #

To update the CSV files needed to produce Esri's style files, first create a folder named "bin" in your local copy of [here](https://github.com/Esri/joint-military-symbology-xml/tree/dev/source/JointMilitarySymbologyLibraryCS/jmsml), then create a  folder named "Debug" within that newly created "bin" folder.

Unzip the contents of [jmsml_console_app_deployment.zip](jmsml_console_app_deployment.zip) into that "Debug" folder.

Then run any desired batch file located under any of the sub-folders under the [samples](https://github.com/Esri/joint-military-symbology-xml/tree/dev/samples) folder, by double clicking on it in Windows Explorer.

To rebuild all of the JMSML sample CSV files, run the [RunAll.bat](https://github.com/Esri/joint-military-symbology-xml/blob/dev/RunAll.bat) file by simply double clicking on it inside Windows Explorer.
